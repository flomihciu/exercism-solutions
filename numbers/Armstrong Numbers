Armstrong Number Checker

An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits,
each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Examples:
    9     → 9^1 = 9              → Armstrong
    10    → 1^2 + 0^2 = 1        → Not Armstrong
    153   → 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 → Armstrong
    154   → 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 190 → Not Armstrong

This function checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number.
