Grains of Wheat – Instructions

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king promised to grant him any reward he could imagine. Knowing the king loved chess, the servant requested grains of wheat: one grain on the first square of a chessboard, two on the second, four on the third — doubling with each square. Your task is to calculate how many grains of wheat appear on specific squares, and how many in total.

1. square(number)

Description: Calculates the number of grains on a specific square of the chessboard.

Parameters:
- number: The square number (must be between 1 and 64)

Returns: The number of grains on that square

Raises:
- If number is less than 1 or greater than 64, raise a ValueError
- Use this message: "square must be between 1 and 64"

Example:
square(3) → 4
square(64) → 9223372036854775808

2. total()

Description: Calculates the total number of grains on all 64 squares of the chessboard.

Returns: The sum of grains on all squares

Formula: Total = 2^64 - 1

Example:
total() → 18446744073709551615

Exception Reminder:

When raising an exception, always include a clear and descriptive message. This improves readability and helps with debugging.

Required message when input is out of range: "square must be between 1 and 64"
